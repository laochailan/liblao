======

This is a personal library I put together to remove boilerplate work from my future projects. It is largely influenced by the code I wrote for taisei and later personal projects and eventually they will be adapted to use it in the end.

If someone else is masochistic enough to use it they are welcome to do so, of course. It's MIT-licensed and I'm trying to maintain a documentation.
